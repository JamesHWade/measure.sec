\title{Calculate Peak Asymmetry Factor}
\usage{
measure_sec_asymmetry(leading, tailing, method = c("usp", "ep"))
}
\arguments{
\item{leading}{Width of the leading (front) half of the peak at the
measurement height.}

\item{tailing}{Width of the tailing (back) half of the peak at the
measurement height.}

\item{method}{Asymmetry calculation method:
\itemize{
\item \code{"usp"} (default): Tailing factor at 5\% height
\item \code{"ep"}: Asymmetry factor at 10\% height
}}
}
\value{
Numeric asymmetry value. Values > 1 indicate tailing, < 1 indicate
fronting. Ideal value is 1.0.
}
\description{
Calculates the asymmetry factor (As) or tailing factor (Tf) for a
chromatographic peak.
}
\details{
Peak asymmetry indicates deviation from ideal Gaussian peak shape:

\strong{USP Tailing Factor (at 5\% height):}
\deqn{T_f = \frac{W_{0.05}}{2f}}

where W_0.05 is the width at 5\% height and f is the leading half-width.

\strong{EP Asymmetry Factor (at 10\% height):}
\deqn{A_s = \frac{b}{a}}

where b is the tailing half-width and a is the leading half-width.

\strong{Interpretation:}
\itemize{
\item As = 1.0: Symmetric (ideal)
\item As < 0.9 or > 1.2: Slight asymmetry (acceptable)
\item As < 0.8 or > 1.5: Significant asymmetry (investigate)
\item As > 2.0: Severe tailing (column/sample issue)
}
